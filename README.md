Very simple screen capture tool written in powershell that attempts to take 30 screenshots a second of the screen and saves them as PNG. 

The folders and files are in the same folder as the exe and are named based on the exact time their were captured followed by a numerical sequence. Each time the start button is pressed, a new folder group is created for better organization.
